# Radicle VS Code Extension Change Log

## _(WIP, yet unreleased version)_

### ‚ú® Highlights

- New Patch Detail view

    <!-- TODO: maninak add screenshot -->

### üöÄ Enhancements

- **patch-detail:** implement new Patch Detail webview showing highly dynamic, in-depth information for a specific Patch
  - can be opened via a new button "View Patch Details" on each item in the list of Patches
  - panel's title shows the patch description in full if it's short, otherwise truncated to the nearest full word fitting the limit
  - the new view's design is purposefully minimal, glanceable, legible, responsive and verbose. It remains familiar to VS Code's native look'n'feel, while also staying true to Radicle's "hacky" vibe. Despite it being a full-fledged custom web-app under the hood, it creates the illusion of it being just another native VS Code UI.
  - view's theme adapts fully and on-the-fly to whichever theme the user configures for his VS Code
  - view has the following main sections:
    - header
    - Patch
    - Revision
    - Activity
  - header section shows the following info:
    - status (e.g. open, merged, archived, ...)
      - the status badge's background color is a dynamic color mix of the patch status color and the dynamic editor-foreground inherited from vscode's current theme so as to ensure text contrast reaching at least [WCAAG AA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable/Color_contrast) level of accessibility at all times while also retaining a relative consistency of the colors across all our UIs
    - major events like "created", "last updated", "merged" and related info with logic crafting optimal copy for each case (see similar tooltip improvements below)
    - a "Refresh" button that refetches from httpd all data of that patch and updating all views that depend on it
    - a "Check Out" button that checks out the Git branch associated with the Radicle Patch shown in the view
      - shown only if the Patch is not checked out
    - a "Check Out Default" button that checks out the Git branch marked as default for the Radicle project
      - shown only if the Patch is checked out
    - "time-ago" for major patch events gets auto-updated to remain accurate as time goes by
  - Patch section shows the following info:
    - checked-out indicator
      - not shown if the Git branch associated with this Radicle Patch is not currently checked out
    - id
      - has on-hover button to copy Patch identifier to clipboard
    - revision author(s)
    - labels
      - not shown if empty
    - title
      - supports markdown
    - description
      - supports markdown
  - Revision section shows the following info:
    - a revision selection dropdown located next to the section heading contains all revisions of the current patch as options
      - if a revision is merged it is auto-selected, otherwise it will be the most recently created
      - revisions are sorted as most-recent-top
      - revisions can be quickly browsed by using the up/down buttons while the dropdown is focused
      - revisions can be quickly searched by typing the beginning of a revision id while the dropdown is focused
      - revision are dynamically formatted so that the list can be scannable for a quick overview, while also showing only whatever info is necessary in each scenario, with the following data
        - shortened revision id
        - "mini"-sized "time-ago"
        - state
          - `merged`
            - suffixed with `/<countOfMergedRevisions>` if more than one revisions got merged e.g. `merged/3`
            - not shown if revision isn't merged
          - `accepted`
            - not shown if the revision doesn't have an `accept` review
          - `rejected`
            - not shown if the revision doesn't have a `reject` review
          - `first`
            - not shown if the revision isn't the earliest one for this patch or if it has only one revision
          - `latest`
            - not shown if the revision isn't the most recent one for this patch or if it has only one revision
          - `sole`
            - not shown if there are more than one revisions
          - not shown if empty
        - author
          - not shown if all revisions are from the same author
    - id
      - has on-hover button to copy revision identifier to clipboard
    - author
    - reviews
      - shows list of Radicle identity aliases who "accepted" and/or "rejected" the selected revision
      - not shown if empty
    - date
      - the full date the selected revision was created, in local timezone
    - latest commit
      - the head commit of the selected revision
    - based on commit
      - the commit the selected revision is branched off of
    - description
      - supports markdown
      - if the selected revision is the first revision, the description is hidden under an expandable-on-click control (to avoid showing the same content twice since it's already shown in the Patch section)
      - not shown if empty
  - Activity section shows the following info:
    - TODO: maninak
  - Markdown parsing comes with multiple additional features such as
    - code highlighting
    - task list e.g. `- [ ] task to do` and `- [X] task done`
    - SVG
    - emoji e.g. `:car:` =>  üöó
    - marked text e.e. `==marked==` => `<mark>inserted</mark>`
    - footnote references e.g.

        ```md
        Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

        [^1]: Here is the footnote.
        [^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
        ```

    - subscript e.g. `C~7~H~14~O~2~`
    - superscript e.g. `x^2^`
    - abbreviation e.g. this input:

        ```md
        *[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
        *[W3C]:  World Wide Web Consortium
        The HTML specification is maintained by the W3C.
        ```

        results in:

        ```html
        <p>The <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> specification is maintained by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>.</p>
        ```

    - automatic table of contents generation wherever the marker `[toc]` is placed
    - automatic linkification of text such as email URIs
  - Patch state remains in sync with all other views
  - where applicable the various data have on-hover indicators hinting that they come with a tooltip which shows additional info such as author's DID, full Id in case it's shortened or localised time (including the timezone used) in full text in case it's a "time-ago", etc
  - all data coming from Radicle is made visually distinct (and a bit more accessible / easier to read) from miscellaneous UI copy by rendering it using a monotype font
- **commands**: add new command to check out the current Radicle project's default Git branch
- **patch-list:** show button to "Check Out Default Git Branch" for the currently checked-out Patch on the list
- **patch-list:** auto-retry fetching list of Patches from httpd (with geometric back-off) if an error occured
- **patch-list:** show the total count of Patches and when the list was last updated as a description next to the "Patches" view title
  - "updated-time-ago" gets auto-updated to remain accurate as time goes by or when the list is manually refreshed
  - in case of fetch error no count will be shown
- **patch-list:** improve Patch tooltip with the following
  - show merge revision id and commit hash (if not already shown in revision event's copy) for merged Patches
  - show latest revision id and commit hash for Patches with more than the initial revision
- **patch-list:** prioritize Patch merge event over latest revision when deriving author and "time-ago" for item's description and order in the list
- **patch-list:** improve legibility of time when Patch events (e.g. created, last updated, merged) happened
  - don't show full dates to make the copy less noisy. The full dates are still available in the new Patch Details view.
  - use custom "time-ago" logic producing more informative results with fewer collisions e.g. "35 days ago" instead of "1 month ago" etc
- **patch-list:** move button for command "Copy Patch Identifier to Clipboard" into Patch item's context menu
- **patch-list:** use smaller dot as separator between data in the description of a Patch item
- **sidebar:** the initial height of the Patches view (e.g. for new projects) will now be 4x that of the CLI Commands view, instead of having the area allocation split 50:50 which resulted in wasted empty space allocated to the later view while the former may have the need for more area to show more content. Subsequent adjustments by the user will be respected and not get overwritten by the initial size.

### üèéÔ∏è Performance

- **patch-list:** only re-render the affected Patch item(s) when checking out a(nother) patch (or a non-patch) branch. Previously all patches had to be re-fetched, parsed and all their list items (and their tooltips!) needed to be instantiated and rendered every time a different git branch got checked out.

### üè° Chores

- **webview:** implement infrastructure for Webviews, effectively individual websites inside a WebviewPanel, enabling the creation of bespoke custom views with the following powerful features
  - webviews can be full blown web-apps powered by Vue.js, Vite, VueUse, TailwindCSS and other great tech
  - UI in Webviews seamlessly blends with VS Code's familiar look'n'feel, even adjusting to each user's color theme
  - Webviews can have bi-directional communication with the host VS Code extension
  - initial state can be injected into a Webview, allowing reuse of already fetched data and reducing the need for loading spinners on init
  - auto-save Webview state (e.g. text in input fields) when it becomes a background tab and auto-restore it when it becomes visible again
  - auto-save Webview state and auto-restore it if VS Code is restarted with the Webview panel open
  - each new Webview panel opens in the currently active ViewColumn, if multi-column layout is in use (i.e. split editors)
  - Webview panel gets reused without being destroyed if it is re-invoked when the user has a ViewColumn active which isn't the one already containing the running Webview
  - text content in Webviews can be searched with Ctrl + F and additional actions Copy/Paste/Cut are available on right click or by using their common keyboard shortcuts
  - Webviews are secured with strict Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **state:** rewrite shared state management across the entire extension from simplistic, localised, highly interdependent and brittle, procedural approach to a new declarative, reactive, global, scalable architecture powered by [`pinia`](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) and [`@vue/reactivity`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vue/reactivity). This enables sharing state across sibling views/entities that was previously too hard, enabling more performant solutions and features that were previously too impractical to tackle, while the code for them can be much more maintainable and less likely to regress in the future.

### üìñ Documentation

- **readme:** fix typos, improve title and intro copy, update milestone link
- **contributing:** document recommended extensions for development with VS Code in [.vscode/extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json) and add related section in the repo's contribution guide.

## **v0.3.2** (Nov 29th, 2023)

### üöÄ Enhancements

- **patch-list:** show a button to check out a Radicle Patch's associated git branch ([#75](https://github.com/cytechmobile/radicle-vscode-extension/issues/75))
  - show an indicator on the Patch's title and tooltip if its associated branch is the currently checked-out git branch
  - keep indicator's state in sync even if the git branch change doesn't happen from within our UI (e.g. `rad patch checkout` or `git checkout` in the terminal)
  - notify user of uncommitted changes when trying to check out a Patch
  - don't show check-out-button for the currently checked-out Patch on the list
- **patch-list:** auto-refresh Patches list when `pathToNodeHome` is updated in the extension settings
- **patch-list:** show a hint-text that radicle-httpd may not be running as the placeholder in Patches list, if that seems to be the case
- **patch-list:** fall back to showing their DID if the revision author's alias isn't defined ([#75](https://github.com/cytechmobile/radicle-vscode-extension/issues/75))
- **patch-list:** use new better-fitting icon for merged Patches ([#75](https://github.com/cytechmobile/radicle-vscode-extension/issues/75))
- **patch-list:** improve the contrast of the colors used by Patch status icons for light themes ([#75](https://github.com/cytechmobile/radicle-vscode-extension/issues/75))

### üèéÔ∏è Performance

- **app:** heavily speed up most procedures by memoizing the resolution of the reference to the rad CLI ([#75](https://github.com/cytechmobile/radicle-vscode-extension/issues/75))
- **patch-list:** heavily speed up (re-)loading of Patches list ([#75](https://github.com/cytechmobile/radicle-vscode-extension/issues/75))
  - measured ~50x faster against a real-world Project with >50 Patches, with the benefit increasing proportionally with the count of Patches on a project

- fix some screenshots that were getting stretched to incorrect ratios

-----

## **v0.3.1** (Oct 3rd, 2023)
