A VS Code extension bringing support for the Radicle network to your IDE.

[Radicle](https://radicle.dev/) is a GitHub alternative with familiar features like Pull Requests, Issues, etc, via a peer-to-peer, free and open-source network built on top of Git.

> **NOTE:** Requires [Radicle HTTP Daemon](https://radicle.dev/download#radicle-httpd-release-name) >=0.17.0

> **NOTE:** The extension currently offers a limited feature set. Removal of HTTPD as a dependency is next up. Beyond that comes deeper integration of Patches and then Issues are next up.
