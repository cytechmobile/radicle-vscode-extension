# Radicle

A VS Code extension bringing support for the Radicle network to your IDE.

[Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) is a Github alternative bringing familiar features (e.g. Pull Requests, Issues, etc) over a free, open-source and peer-to-peer network, built on top of Git.

> **NOTE:** The extension currently offers partial support for the latest version of the Radicle CLI (codename "Heartwood"). Support for Radicle Patches is [under active develpment](https://github.com/cytechmobile/radicle-vscode-extension/milestone/3) and further features like Issues are next on the pipeline.
