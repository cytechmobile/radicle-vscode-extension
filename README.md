A VS Code extension bringing support for the Radicle network to your IDE.

[Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) is a GitHub alternative bringing familiar features like Pull Requests, Issues, etc, via a peer-to-peer, free and open-source network built on top of Git.

> **NOTE:** The extension currently offers partial support for the latest version of the Radicle CLI (codename "Heartwood"). Support for Radicle Patches is [under active development](https://github.com/cytechmobile/radicle-vscode-extension/milestone/5) and further features like Issues are next on the pipeline.
