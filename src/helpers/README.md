# Directory Description

Place under `helpers` all functions that only make sense in the context of this repo/app/solution.

No functions should directly invoke user interactions such as showing notifications, input boxes, etc. Instead, such logic should be extracted into functions placed under the `ux` directory.
All exported functions should be documented with JSDoc annotations.
